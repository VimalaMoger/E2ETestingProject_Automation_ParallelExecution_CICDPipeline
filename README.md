- Parallally executed both tests in Maven POM.xml or using TestNG xml file
- Docker- installed docker desktop, performed test code execution
- GitHub push/actions
- Execute the code in Jenkins

In this project, I worked with selenium, focusing on xpath locator strategy to be able to locate web elements. Automated the process and printed the products page title and first product name to the console.
Implied test strategy using TestNG(parameterization-receives browsername), 
Included additional code for taking screenshots saving to a file
Generated reports based on whether test fails or passes with screenshot attached
Ran the test code in docker container both standalone and in selenium grid, creating nodes for both chrome and firefox browsers. Developed docker-compose files for both
Handled the Some of Docker and browser errors, done with code execution.
